Overview
The Linux command line is a text interface to your computer. Often referred to as the shell, terminal, 
console, prompt or various other names, it can give the appearance of being complex and confusing to use. 
Yet the ability to copy and paste commands from a website, combined with the power and flexibility the command line offers, 
means that using 
it may be essential when trying to follow instructions online, including many on this very website!

This tutorial will teach you a little of the history of the command line, then walk you through some practical excercises 
to become familiar with a few basic commands and concepts. We’ll assume no prior knowledge, but by the end we hope you’ll feel 
a bit more comfortable the next time you’re faced with some instructions that begin “Open a terminal”.
